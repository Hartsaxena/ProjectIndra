Hello, fellow user!

It's me, Indra!
I see you've given in to boredom (or curiosity) and have started to look around the game files!
Good for you!
Whether or not you actually know how to program (specifically in Python 3), I hope you can learn something from this!

Be careful if you want to change any variables or so-called "Constants" (Python doesn't have any), because if you don't know what you're doing, you might break something.

Thanks for Downloading this Project!

You could be looking through this most-likely empty file and thinking "What is this used for?"

This is basically a folder that exists for the sole purpose of allowing users to add their own programs to it!
There is a Path variable that's already assigned to this folder in the files:

custom = Path(indrafolder / "Misc/custom")

Thank you!
If you don't plan on modifying this game in any way, then you can just delete this folder.
If you change your mind, you just need to create an empty folder called "custom", just like this one!

Thank you for downloading this program.

With love,
         - Indra

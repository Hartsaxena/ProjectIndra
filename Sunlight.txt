Where will I find the next Sunlight?

The pile of what people call "Hobbies" is overwhelming.
The shadow of doubt is beseeching.

I ask myself when the light will come,
But I already know it has already gone.

And as the chaos and order fight,
The mixture of the two blocks our sight.

Where will we find the next Sunlight?

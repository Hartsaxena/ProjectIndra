You might be going through the game folder and asking yourself "What is Misc?"

Well you're in luck! Because this file will explain what Misc files are!

If you didn't know, "Misc" stands for Miscellaneous which is pretty much another word for "Random"
These are the files that I couldn't decide where to place, so this is where they ended up.
Most of these files are just helper files (Files that assist Main files) that make make the code less crowded and easier for me to understand.

If you want to add more things to the game, I recommend putting your modded files in A folder called "custom". I've already made a Path variable for this folder:

custom = Path(indrafolder / "Misc/custom")

Good luck modding!

If you're not here to mod (which you probably aren't), then Good luck... Playing?

With love,
